Here, you are importing [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and calling it `tf` for convention and ease of use.\n","\n","You then import a library called [`numpy`](https://numpy.org) which helps to represent data as arrays easily and to optimize numerical operations.\n","\n","The framework you will use to build a neural network as a sequence of layers is called [`keras`](https://keras.io/) so you will import that too.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Define and Compile the Neural Network\n","\n","Next, you will create the simplest possible neural network.

You will build this model using Keras' [Sequential](https://keras.io/api/models/sequential/) class which allows you to define the network as a sequence of [layers](https://keras.io/api/layers/). You can use a single [Dense](https://keras.io/api/layers/core_layers/dense/) layer to build this simple network as shown below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Now, you will compile the neural network.

But in this case, it's nicely encapsulated in functions and classes for you. But what happens here? Let's explain...\n","\n","You know that in the function declared at the start of this notebook, the relationship between the numbers is `y=2x-1`. When the computer is trying to 'learn' that, it makes a guess... maybe `y=10x+10`. The `loss` function measures the guessed answers against the known correct answers and measures how well or how badly it did.\n","\n","It then uses the `optimizer` function to make another guess. Based on how the loss function went, it will try to minimize the loss. At that point maybe it will come up with something like `y=5x+5`, which, while still pretty bad, is closer to the correct result (i.e. the loss is lower).\n","\n","It will repeat this for the number of _epochs_ which you will see shortly. But first, here's how you will tell it to use [mean squared error](https://keras.io/api/losses/regression_losses/#meansquarederror-function) for the loss and [stochastic gradient descent](https://keras.io/api/optimizers/sgd/) for the optimizer.
